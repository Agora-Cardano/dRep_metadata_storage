    "comment": "I vote NO on the NCL proposal for 2025 and 2026 because it fails to protect the Cardano community’s treasury, which belongs to Cardano, not IOG, and allows IOG undue control while exposing systemic flaws in the budget mechanism. The NCL should be a percentage of the treasury (e.g., 15%, or 256M ADA), applied only for 2025, to avoid premature commitments for 2026. Each entity, including IOG, must have a request cap (e.g., 50%, or 850M ADA) to ensure fairness. Despite the complexities of limiting identity verification for treasury requests, allowing any entity or individual to request such large amounts without restrictions is a fundamental design flaw that risks exploitation; approving a total NCL without per-group limits fosters dynamics of control, submission, monopolies, and centralization, which contradict Cardano’s vision of decentralized, distributed decision-making. Without addressing these issues, this mechanism enables IOG’s dominance over the community through 2027, and I urge a serious reevaluation to prioritize Cardano’s decentralized governance."
