    "comment": "Rationale – Abstain Vote on the 300M ADA NCL (Epochs 563–635)\nAs a dRep, I am casting an abstain vote on this governance action.\n\nThe proposed 300M ADA cap for Epochs 563–635 is technically reasonable and aligned with the Treasury’s projected inflows. It also represents roughly double the annual withdrawal amount previously seen in the Project Catalyst program (~50M ADA per four-month cycle), which should not result in exaggerated sell pressure — especially considering that most proposals will likely be disbursed over time in tranches tied to deliverables.\n\nStill, I cannot fully endorse the way this NCL has been structured. My concerns include:\n\nIt initiates a budget cycle mid-calendar year, which may further confuse proposers and dReps. While not the most critical issue, this desynchronization introduces unnecessary inconsistency and reduces predictability in treasury coordination and planning.\n\nIt includes no mechanism to limit how much a single entity, group, or proposal may request from the total NCL amount. This leaves room for excessive concentration of funds and repeats problematic dynamics seen previously — such as budget dominance by large actors.\n\nI acknowledge that including such limits within the NCL governance action itself would likely violate the Cardano Constitution, which defines the NCL solely as a cap on total withdrawals.\nHowever, I believe it is good practice for any group proposing an NCL to also outline a strategy to establish such guardrails and percentage limits in a follow-up governance action.\nSo far, this concern has not been addressed or signaled as a priority by any of the current proposers.\n\nSuch a complementary governance action could provide political guidance for dReps when voting on future Budget or Treasury Withdrawal Actions, promoting fairer and more decentralized distribution of Treasury resources — a principle this community is proud to stand for.\n\nWhile I voted NO on the previous 200M ADA NCL due to the risk of centralizing nearly all treasury funds around IOG proposals, I am abstaining here because I see the 300M ADA limit as a more appropriate compromise — one that could still allow critical community-led initiatives to receive funding and reduce overconcentration in the ecosystem.\n\nMy abstention is a rejection of the current structure, without blocking the continuity of treasury operations. I remain committed to pushing for structural reforms that strengthen the legitimacy, predictability, and fairness of Cardano’s budget process."
